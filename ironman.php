					<b>Iron Man</b> is a fictional character, a superhero that appears
					in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was
					created by writer-editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry
					Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. He made
					his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (March 1963).

				<h2>
					<b>Powers</b>
				</h2>
				<p class="delivery">After being critically injured during a
					battle with the Extremis-enhanced Mallen, Stark injects his nervous
					system with modified techno-organic virus-like body restructuring
					machines (the Extremis process).[92] By rewriting his own biology,
					Stark is able to save his life, gain an enhanced healing factor,
					and partially merge with the Iron Man armor, superseding the need
					for bulky, AI-controlled armors in favor of lighter designs,
					technopathically controlled by his own brain. His enhanced
					technopathy extends to every piece of technology, limitless and
					effortlessly due to his ability to interface with communication
					satellites and wireless connections to increase his "range". Some
					components of the armor-sheath are now stored in Tony's body, able
					to be recalled, and extruded from his own skin, at will.</p>
				<h2>
					<b>Skills</b>
				</h2>
				<p class="delivery">Tony Stark is an inventive genius whose
					expertise in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and
					computer science rivals that of Reed Richards, Hank Pym, and Bruce
					Banner, and his expertise in electrical engineering and mechanical
					engineering surpasses even theirs. He is regarded as one of the
					most intelligent characters in the Marvel Universe. He graduated
					with advanced degrees in physics and engineering at the age of 17
					from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)[96] and further
					developed his knowledge ranging from artificial intelligence to
					quantum mechanics as time progressed. His expertise extends to his
					ingenuity in dealing with difficult situations, such as difficult
					foes and deathtraps, in which he is capable of using available
					tools, including his suit, in unorthodox but effective ways. He is
					well respected in the business world, able to command people's
					attention when he speaks on economic matters, having over the years
					built up several multi-million dollar companies from virtually
					nothing. He is noted for the loyalty he commands from and returns
					to those who work for him, as well as for his business ethics. Thus
					he immediately fired an employee who made profitable, but illegal,
					sales to Doctor Doom.[33] He strives to be environmentally
					responsible in his businesses.</p>
