					<b>Superman</b> is a superhero that appears in comic books
					published by DC Comics, and is considered an American cultural
					icon. Superman was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe
					Shuster, high school students living in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1933;
					the character was sold to Detective Comics, Inc. (later DC Comics)
					in 1938. Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1 (June 1938)
					and subsequently appeared in various radio serials, television
					programs, films, newspaper strips, and video games. With the
					success of his adventures, Superman helped to create the superhero
					genre and establish its primacy within the American comic book.

				<h2>
					<b>Powers</b>
				</h2>
				<p class="delivery">As an influential archetype of the superhero
					genre, Superman possesses extraordinary powers, with the character
					traditionally described as "faster than a speeding bullet, more
					powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a
					single bound", a phrase coined by Jay Morton and first used in the
					Superman radio serials and Max Fleischer animated shorts of the
					1940s[109] as well as the TV series of the 1950s. For most of his
					existence, Superman's famous arsenal of powers has included flight,
					super-strength, invulnerability to non-magical attacks,
					super-speed, vision powers (including x-ray, heat-emitting,
					telescopic, infra-red, and microscopic vision), super-hearing,
					super-intelligence, and super-breath, which enables him to blow out
					air at freezing temperatures, as well as exert the propulsive force
					of high-speed winds.</p>
